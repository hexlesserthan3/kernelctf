# Sort through the Riff raff
QUESTION: Dan the music man knows almost everything there is to know about music. Sometimes, his sites get corrupted. What an unfortune day for dear old Dan. He still really knows a lot, especially about curating riffs.


## reddit post
bad 2012 remaster - 1:26 from my actual reddit account 
will be commenting on that using the dan the music man account

## solution
1. the website in the comments will have the first halves of the spotify links and the timestamps during which the second half will show up during the video (which looks like an error video (hopefully)
2. the subreddit has a youtube link to a playlist that has the video which has the second halves of the spotify links
3. the website is in wolseley cipher (each ciphered word is repeated 6 times since there are 6 riffs) and it spells out "first letter of every album name" - the part before the ciphers are russian and say "step 1", "step 2" and so on.

## subreddit: riff_curators
username: dan-the-music-man

## to-do:
1. add more red herring videos to the playlist
2. make the website functional
3. comment on the reddit post and say "wrong, heres the link to the actual best riffs of all time"
