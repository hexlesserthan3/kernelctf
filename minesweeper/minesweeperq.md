# minesweeper question
PLEASE remove the print bombs part!!!! in the final python code. (code itself could be more obscure)

## placement of the incorrect numbers
the row and column number of the incorrect numbers are important in the order that it is given (as in 4,1 is the first bit, 2,4 is the second bit, 0,7 is the third and so on)
- 4,8 > 6
- 8,0 > 2
- 9,0 > 1
- 7,2 > 4
- 9,9 > 5
- 4,1 > 0
- 5,2 > 9
- 7,5 > 3
- 8,4 > 8 
- 9,5 > 7
some of the cells with diff numbers should disappear if you "win" or click on any of the bombs after game over, making the touching of bombs important

### in order it is: 41 90 80 75 72 99 48 95 84 52
